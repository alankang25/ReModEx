## Pipeline
### Below is an outline of the pipeline which takes in an ENCODE formatted TSV file, ATAC-seq BigWig and peak files pre- and post- treatment to list the importance of various chromatin features in explaining accessibility changes across treatment groups. In this example, data from BRG1/BRM Associated Factors Complex (BAF) inhibited GM12878 cells will be used.
